Website for Restaurant in Bungendore. Still waiting on menu details, updated photos and answers to FAQs. This has been a fun project, I enjoyed animating and creating a useScroll hook to monitor the Y axis. Building the contact form was good practice, I did this a different way to usual, using Axios and it was much more concise.
